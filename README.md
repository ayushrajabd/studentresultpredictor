# ðŸŽ“ Student Performance Predictor

This is my minor project.  
It predicts a student's **final exam score** using:
- Attendance
- Study Hours
- Past Score

---

## ðŸ“Œ How I made it
1. I collected a small dataset (`student_performance.csv`).  
2. I trained two models:
   - Linear Regression  
   - Random Forest Regressor  
3. I compared both and saved the best model (`student_model.pkl`).  
4. I created a Streamlit app (`app.py`) to make predictions easily.
